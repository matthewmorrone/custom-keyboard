Bugs
- sometimes when using the case-changing feature, it works, but afterwards the selection jumps to somewhere earlier in the text
- if there are too many entries in a key's popup, it doesn't render properly
- sometimes when cutting/copying/pasting large chunks of text, those keys will stop working until the keyboard is disabled and reenabled
- the contents of the custom keys aren't printed on the keys until something is pressed

Changes
- the template had gesture typing, get that back
- the template had autocorrect, get that back
- label size issue for high surrogates
- popup should close when tapping outside of it
